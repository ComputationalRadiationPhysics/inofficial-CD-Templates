## Color Palettes

### Inkscape
In Linux, the color palette file [HZDR.gpl](colorpalettes/inkscape/HZDR.gpl) needs to be saved in the folder `~/.config/inkscape/palettes/`.
Afterwards, it will be a selectable palette within inkscape.  

Note, that the colors *Hellblau 1* and *Hellblau 2* are none of the official colors, but match the hue of the official blue tones and are probably acceptable. In the [Corporate Design Manual](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pOid=31856) the scientific posters use "lighter blue or gray tones" and served as templates for the additional colors.
